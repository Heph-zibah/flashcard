## Component Structure

### `FlashcardForm`

**Props:**

- `newQuestion: string` – Current input for the question  
- `setNewQuestion: (value: string) => void` – State setter for the question input  
- `newAnswer: string` – Current input for the answer  
- `setNewAnswer: (value: string) => void` – State setter for the answer input  
- `addFlashcard: () => void` – Function to save a new flashcard  

**Features:**

- Uses **Shadcn Input, Label, and Button** components  
- Button is **disabled** if either input is empty (`isFormValid` check)  
- Responsive layout with **TailwindCSS**  

**Code Example:**

```ts
const isFormValid = newQuestion.trim() !== "" && newAnswer.trim() !== "";
<Button disabled={!isFormValid} onClick={addFlashcard}>Add Flashcard</Button>

### `FlashcardList` (Assumed based on project context)

**Props / Features:**

- Displays a list of all flashcards  
- Allows each flashcard to be flipped to reveal the answer  
- Lets users mark flashcards as learned  

**Code Example:**

```ts
{flashcards.map((card) => (
  <Flashcard
    key={card.id}
    question={card.question}
    answer={card.answer}
    learned={card.learned}
    toggleLearned={() => markAsLearned(card.id)}
  />
))}

```
## Form Validation

The app ensures both inputs are filled before allowing the flashcard to be added.  
This prevents empty submissions and improves user experience.

```ts
const isFormValid = newQuestion.trim() !== "" && newAnswer.trim() !== "";
<Button disabled={!isFormValid}>Add Flashcard</Button>

```
